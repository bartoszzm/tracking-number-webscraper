This code retrieves tracking numbers from a Google Sheet and uses them to scrape delivery status information from the USPS website. It then updates the Google Sheet with the extracted delivery status and date information.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

The necessary libraries, including BeautifulSoup, requests, and gspread, are imported.

The code establishes a connection with the Google Sheet named "Get tracking" and selects the worksheet named "testing" for further operations.

A custom user-agent header is set to mimic a browser for the requests made to the USPS website.

The code iterates over a range of rows, from 1 to 24 (exclusive).

For each row, the tracking number is retrieved from the corresponding cell in the Google Sheet.

Using the tracking number, a URL is constructed to access the USPS website's tracking page for that specific package.

A GET request is sent to the USPS website with the constructed URL, and the response content is parsed using BeautifulSoup.

The code extracts the delivery status and date information from the parsed HTML content.

The extracted delivery status and date are updated in the Google Sheet, in the respective columns for each row.

The URL and delivery status are printed for verification purposes.

Optional lines for additional checking, such as printing the delivery date and tracking number, are included but commented out.

The code effectively automates the process of retrieving delivery status information from the USPS website for a list of tracking numbers stored in a Google Sheet, allowing for efficient tracking and updating of package statuses in the sheet.
